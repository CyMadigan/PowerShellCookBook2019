# Book Errata

A considerable amount of time was expended proofreading the book details.
Besides the author there were several other people who also looked for errors.
Sadly, not all errors were caught during production but not all.

This document describes the errors found.

## Errors

### Preface

Page IX, 4th paragraph, second line, should read:  
"spelled out in full. Thus, no abbreviated parameter names or positional parameters. This"

### Chapter 1 - Establishing a PowerShell Administrative Environment

Page 12, 2nd Paragraph, penultimate line - the sentence should read:  "And for versions later than 1803, the
mechanism may change again."
And with the passage of time since the book was written, the mechanism has indeed changed again.
